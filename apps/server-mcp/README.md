-   **Auto-launch**: Set the app to start with your system

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The desktop app uses the same environment configuration as the standalone server:

```bash
# Required
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000        # Dinary API URL
DINARY_AUTH_EMAIL=<your-email>             # Dinary login email
DINARY_AUTH_PASSWORD=<your-password>       # Dinary password

# Optional
DINARY_AUTO_LOGIN=true                     # Enable automatic login
DINARY_MCP_DEBUG=true                      # Enable debug logging
DINARY_MCP_AUTO_START=true                 # Auto-start server on app launch
```


### Configuration File

Settings are automatically saved to:

-   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/dinary-mcp-server/config.json`
-   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/dinary-mcp-server/config.json`
-   **Linux**: `~/.config/dinary-mcp-server/config.json`

## Integration with AI Assistants

The desktop app runs the same MCP server as the standalone version, making it compatible with:

### Claude Desktop

1. Start the desktop app and ensure the server is running
2. Note the server path shown in the app (typically: `dist/apps/mcp/index.js`)
3. Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
"mcpServers": {
        "dinary": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/path/shown/in/desktop/app"],
            "env": {
                "API_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
                "DINARY_AUTH_EMAIL": "<your-email>",
                "DINARY_AUTH_PASSWORD": "<your-password>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Other AI Assistants

The underlying MCP server uses stdio transport, making it compatible with any AI assistant supporting the MCP standard.

## Available MCP Tools

The desktop app provides access to all Dinary MCP tools through its managed server:

### 🔑 Authentication Flow

The server uses a streamlined authentication approach:

1. **Login**: Uses email/password to authenticate with Dinary API
2. **User Context Capture**: Automatically gets tenant ID and organization ID from `/api/user/me`
3. **Parameter Injection**: All tools automatically use your organization/tenant context
4. **Token Management**: Handles refresh tokens and session management automatically

### 🛠️ Available Tools (91 tools across 8 categories)

-   **🧑‍💼 Employee Tools (15 tools)**: Complete employee management
-   **📋 Task Tools (16 tools)**: Comprehensive task operations
-   **🗂️ Project Tools (15 tools)**: Full project lifecycle management
